I made a converter jpg image to ASCII-art on python, i use Pillow and PyGObject for GTK
# How to use?
use in terminal (console) - python asciiart.py yourimg.jpg

# NEW VERSION
hey guys, I made a new version of the app, now it uses GTK! I'm using GNOME so it looks cool for me, I'll do it later with Qt

# Bags

1. Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/superuser/asciiart.py", line 1, in <module>
    from PIL import Image
  
install the Pillow

`python3 -m venv myenv`

`source myenv/bin/activate` (On Linux)

`pip install pillow PyGObject`

2. Perhaps the ASCII art in the application will be crooked, but if you save it in txt, everything will be fine with it.
